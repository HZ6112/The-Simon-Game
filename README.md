# The-Simon-Game

Game Setup:  The game consists of a circular console with four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow) arranged in a specific pattern. It also features a small speaker that emits tones corresponding to each colored button.

Objective: The objective of the game is to follow and repeat a sequence of lights and sounds produced by the game. The sequence starts with a single button lighting up and emitting a specific sound. The player's goal is to remember the sequence and replicate it correctly.

Gameplay:The user must perform a keypress to start the game. The game begins with the console producing a single sequence. For example, it might start with the red button lighting up and emitting a tone. The player then presses the red button to mimic the sequence. If the player correctly replicates the sequence, the game adds another step by randomly lighting up and sounding one of the buttons. The player must then remember and reproduce this expanded sequence. The game continues in this manner, gradually increasing the complexity of the sequence.If the user hit the sequence in an incorrect manner, the website will tell that game over and asked to restart the game.
